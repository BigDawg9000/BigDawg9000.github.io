            <h2>Connection to Astronomy 121</h2>
            <p>James B. Pollacks work is deeply tied to the class themes of planetary atmospheres, climate evolution, and planetary formation. His research on the greenhouse effect on Venus and the Martian climate directly supports our studies of comparative planetology and planetary habitability. Additionally, his "core accretion paradigm" for giant planet formation provides a foundation for understanding the processes behind the formation of the solar system, a central topic in class. Pollacks models of Mars atmospheric circulation and his work on the potential impacts of asteroid collisions illustrate how planetary science bridges theoretical concepts with practical exploration and real-world concerns.</p>
            <h2>Personal Connection</h2>
            <p>This project highlighted the human side of science, showing that scientists like Pollack are not only brilliant but also face personal challenges and bring unique perspectives to their work. His ability to balance groundbreaking research with personal resilience reframes my view of solar system astronomy as a deeply collaborative and evolving field, shaped by individuals driven by curiosity and determination. It also emphasizes how science is not separate from life but intertwined with broader societal and personal contexts, inspiring me to see my own potential contributions to scientific exploration.</p>
