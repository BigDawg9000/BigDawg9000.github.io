Hello, this is the Directory for my final project, the link to access the webpage is: 
https://bigdawg9000.github.io/pollack_webpage/index.html

If that doesnt work or if some of the images arent showing up, try going to the code tab

Once at the code tab, select download Zip,

Open the pig file, then launch index.html, and the website will work off your local computer as opposed to the github server
